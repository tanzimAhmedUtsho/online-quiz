# Getting Started with Create React App

- The website named Online Quiz has been created. Here we use Bootstrap library . Where the data is loaded from the API by four cards in the home. Still if the start button is clicked the quizzes will continue to start. If you navigate between topics, the quiz topics will show. And start quiz will start the quiz. Then the quizzes will be shown in green if correct and red if incorrect. And if we click on the eye icon given here, we can see the correct answer.

- The function of the statistics button is to show how many quizzes are given here, such as how many quizzes of React, how many quizzes of Java Script, how many quizzes of CSS, how many quizzes of bricks are shown here as a chart. Even if it is a mouse we can see it.

- If we click on the block button, we will see some questions and some blogs and there the blog blog is said in detail.
